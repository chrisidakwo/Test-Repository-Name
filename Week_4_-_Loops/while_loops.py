# A while loop is a loop that runs based on a condition. The loop does not end, until a set condition resolves to False

# One of the common ways of control the execution of a whole loop is with the use of a flag/flag variable

count = 1

while count <= 20:
    # run the code indented in the while block
    print(count)

    count = count + 1
    

print("I'm outside the while loop")

# TODO: Use break and continue statement
